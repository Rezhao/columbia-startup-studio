## 1. The “Inspiration-to-Reality Gap” (+1 +1)

**Problem**  
Renters see beautiful rooms on Pinterest but have no idea how to recreate them in *their* specific space, within budget, and under landlord restrictions.

**Why They Care**  
They’re paying $2,500+/month for a space that doesn’t feel like “them.” Aspirational content creates frustration, not motivation.

**Solution**  
Upload a photo of your actual room + an inspiration image.  
AI identifies what’s achievable (e.g., paint isn’t, but that lamp and rug layout is), suggests affordable dupes, and shows a realistic mockup.

- **Clarity:** 5 — Very clear pain point

**Problem**  
Renters find furniture they love online but can’t visualize if it’ll fit or look right in an oddly shaped NYC apartment.
