# Lean Canvas — Inspiration-to-Reality Gap  
**Target User:** NYC Apartment Renters inspired by Pinterest / Social Media

---

## Problem (Top 3)

1. Inspiration doesn’t translate to *their* actual apartment (size, layout, lighting).
2. Budget constraints and renter restrictions (no drilling, no painting) block execution.
3. Too much inspiration leads to decision paralysis with no clear next step.

---

## Customer Segments

- NYC apartment renters (ages 20s–40s)  
- Heavy Pinterest / Instagram / TikTok home-content consumers

## Solution (Top 3 Features)

1. Upload room photo + inspiration image → AI feasibility breakdown  
2. Renter-safe substitutions and affordable dupes (e.g., paint → peel-and-stick)  
3. Realistic visual mockup of *their* actual space with selected items

# New Idea Exploration  
## “Beli, but for Social Activities in New York City”

**Status:** New concept (not from AI-generated list)
